Course given by: Gauthier PICARD, Professor. PhD. HDR at the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Ã©tienne.

Here is his statement of the problem: https://www.emse.fr/~picard/cours/ai/csp/index.html

The source files were written by Pr. Gauthier PICARD (inspired from the algorithm provided by AIMA-Java Project), then completed by us following the exercices presented in the previous link. The three following problems were modelised and solved by me and my colleague Younes Gueddari.

The files are to be found in the src folder of the Java Project.
